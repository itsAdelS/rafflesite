Send the postcard to: Collinwood Auto Service, 1771 Ivanhoe Rd, Cleveland, Ohio 44112. Each postcard submitted will count as ONE (1) entry into the Sweepstakes. All entries must be postmarked by December 23, 2025, and received by March 23, 2026. Each entry must be submitted separately. Entries submitted by anyone other than the Entrant are void.

The approximate retail value (ARV) of the Grand Prize is $161,500 USD.

The color, options, and accessories of the vehicle will be determined at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. The vehicle may have mileage, and the Grand Prize Winner must present proof of existing full coverage of vehicle insurance at the time of delivery.
